 * target, so quick presses add up. The run ends with one seek [waitMs] after the last key, at once on OK, or
 * without a seek on Back. Only while thumbnails run for this playback: without one to look at the seek goes on
 * release. Gentle waits [HOLD_SETTLE_MS] after a tap too; Fast never waits. Confirm with OK opens a run paused too
 * and without thumbnails, and only OK seeks: after [CONFIRM_IDLE_MS] without a key the run ends without one.
